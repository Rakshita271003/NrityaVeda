  <h2>About Kathak</h2>
  <p>
    Kathak, one of the eight major forms of Indian classical dance, is the soul of storytelling through movement. The name "Kathak" is derived from the Sanskrit word <em>katha</em>, meaning "story", and <em>kathakar</em>, meaning "the one who tells a story". Rooted in the ancient tradition of traveling bards of North India, Kathak began as an oral art — performed in village courtyards, temple halls, and festivals — where stories from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas were brought to life through graceful gestures and rhythmic footwork.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over centuries, Kathak evolved from devotional expression into a refined art form. During the Bhakti movement, it thrived in temples as a means of divine storytelling, particularly the tales of Lord Krishna and Radha. With the arrival of the Mughal courts, Kathak absorbed elements of Persian aesthetics — becoming more sophisticated, abstract, and adorned with elaborate costumes, intricate spins (chakkars), and expressive facial artistry.
  </p>
  <p>
    What distinguishes Kathak is its unique blend of rhythm and grace. Dancers wear ankle bells (<em>ghungroos</em>) and perform complex footwork patterns synchronized with tabla and pakhawaj beats, while expressing deep emotions through hand gestures (<em>mudras</em>) and facial expressions (<em>abhinaya</em>). The circular movements, sharp pirouettes, and poetic expressions transport the audience into a world of divine elegance and narrative depth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, Kathak continues to enchant global audiences — whether on grand stages, fusion collaborations, or spiritual gatherings — preserving its classical purity while embracing modern expression. It is not just a dance; it is poetry in motion, a rhythm of devotion, and a timeless celebration of Indian heritage.
